# California Housing Prices Prediction
by: Shane Cupid

This project is a comprehensive analysis and prediction of housing prices in California. The dataset used in this project is based on data from the 1990 California census. It is a great dataset for exploring various data science concepts, including feature engineering, regression analysis, and more.

## Technologies used
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Description
The main goal of this project is to use the features in the dataset to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and applying machine learning algorithms.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Install Python 3 from the official website.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook. It is recommended to install it via Anaconda. Here's a [guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-jupyter-notebook) on how to install it.
3. Install the required Python libraries for this project. You can do this by running `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn` in your command line.
4. Clone this repository to your local machine.
5. Navigate to the local repository and run `jupyter notebook` in your command line. This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
6. Open the notebook and run the cells to see the analysis and predictions.
